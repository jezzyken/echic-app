<h3> CARING FOR AN INJURED CHICKEN</h3> 

  
<div style="clear: both;"></div>



 <p> <strong>FOOD & WATER</strong></p>

 <p>
	Keep the injured chicken hydrated throughout the crisis even if that means offering water by spoon or dropper frequently.  Water  is involved in every aspect of a chickenâ€™s metabolism from regulating body temperature to digesting food, and eliminating body wastes and a dehydrated bird will have difficulty recovering.
</p>

<p>
	Food is much less critical than water initially for an injured bird, but if the chicken is not eating independently in a day or so after the injury, they can be fed by spoon,  dropper, syringe or tube fed a liqued diet.
