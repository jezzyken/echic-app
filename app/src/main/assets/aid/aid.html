<h3> Infirmary & Recovery Space</h3> 

  
<div style="clear: both;"></div>



 <p> <strong>Infirmary &amp; Recovery Space</strong></p>

 <p>Have a dedicated with soft bedding material (pine shavings, a soft towel, etc) set aside for chicken emergencies. The chicken hospital area should be a quiet space inside the house, garage or basement where the chicken will remain until fully recovered. It should be conveniently located for frequent observation. I highly recommend using a dog kennel cage  because they are spacious, easy to clean and cage cup for foods and pultry nipple drinkers can be hung from the top or sides easily, which keep the bedding food and water clean and dry.</p>
