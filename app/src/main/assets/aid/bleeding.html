<h3> CARING FOR AN INJURED CHICKEN</h3> 

  
<div style="clear: both;"></div>



 <p> <strong>STOP ANY BLEEDING</strong></p>

 <p>
	Using a clean towel, gauze or paper towel, apply gentle, but firm pressure to an actively bleeding injury until it stops. Wearing vinyl gloves  is a good idea when treating wounds. Blood stop powder can be applied to superficial wounds after active bleeding has been controlled. Bleeding wounds often look much worse than they actually are before they are controlled and cleaned up.
