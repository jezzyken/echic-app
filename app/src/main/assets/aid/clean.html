<h3> CARING FOR AN INJURED CHICKEN</h3> 

  
<div style="clear: both;"></div>



 <p> <strong>ASSESS & CLEAN THE INJURIES</strong></p>

 <p>
	Examine the chicken from head to toe. Feathers may conceal wounds and bathing the bird makes finding them easier, particularly with puncture wounds from a hawkâ€™s talons, for instance. If necessary, trim or pluck feathers in the vicinity of a wound to prevent interference with healing. Be very careful none of the feathers are newly emerging pin feathers, however.

</p>

<p>
	All wounds should be thoroughly cleaned. Water with betadine, chlorhexadine 2% solution spray, or Verericyn Wound Care Spray can all be used for cleaning superficial wounds.
