 <p>Chicken scratch is not the same as chicken feed. Try and imagine chicken scratch as a kind of treat for your flock. Most chicken scratch varieties consist mostly of cracked corn and other grains that chooks love to eat but are unfortunately not very good their waistlines. Chicken scratch is a great source of energy for your flock and can also help warm their bellies on chilly winter nights. However, always remember that chicken scratch is not the cornerstone of a health diet - it is a delicious treat that every chook should enjoy every now and then.</p>
