 <p>Pellets are perhaps the most common variety of chicken feed available. Just like it sounds pellets are essentially little compact cylinders of chicken feed goodness. One of the benefits of using pellets is that they hold their shape nicle, which means they wonâ€™t go to waste if your ladies accidentally knock their <a href="/blogs/learning-centre/5-essential-things-you-need-to-know-about-chicken-feeders-before-you-buy">feeder</a> over. Easy to manage, store and serve, pellets often become the first choice for most backyard chicken keepers.</p>
